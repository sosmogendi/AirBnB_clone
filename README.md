# AirBnB Clone Project

## Project Description

Welcome to our AirBnB Clone project repository! In this project, we're building a command-line interpreter for managing AirBnB objects using Python. The command interpreter allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete various objects such as users, states, cities, and places, while focusing on key concepts like serialization, unit testing, and CLI interaction.

## Command Interpreter

### How to Start

To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd [project directory]`
3. Run the command interpreter: `./console.py`

### How to Use

Once the command interpreter is running, you can interact with it using the following commands:

- `help`: Display the list of available commands.
- `create [class_name]`: Create a new instance of the specified class.
- `show [class_name] [object_id]`: Display information about a specific object.
- `all [class_name]` or `all`: Display a list of all objects of the specified class or all objects.
- `update [class_name] [object_id] [attribute_name] [attribute_value]`: Update attributes of a specific object.
- `destroy [class_name] [object_id]`: Delete a specific object.
